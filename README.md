An updated version of my first pxl-clicker project, fully remade with react with tons of new additions.

I'm using this to learn React mainly. But I do hope to eventually launch a live site for this.

## Whats new/Overview?

- Fully updated UI
- New loading screen
- Updated assets
- A new type of battle system

- Better level scaling
